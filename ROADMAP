This is an informal roadmap - no promise

ROADMAP

Version 2.1.0
- add full support for multisession (this is too intrusive to still call 2.0.xx stable)
- usual bug fixes and improvments
  http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-idr-bgp-extended-messages-02.txt
- an exception interception wrapper so forked process do not die on signal sent to exabgp
- have a command to shutdown the process properly
- check that the route received are well from a family negociated during the OPEN

LATER
- look what fun RFC we could implement from the list at 
  http://code.google.com/p/exabgp/wiki/RFC

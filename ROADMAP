This is an informal roadmap - no promise

ROADMAP

Version 3.
- usual bug fixes and improvments (bugs ? which bugs ?)
- protect the forked process do not have to deal with SIGHUP or others signals sent to exabgp (done ? to test)
- finish mpls-vpn support
- multiple configuration files as paramter (considering)
- have a command to shutdown the process properly
- check that the route received are well from a family negociated during the OPEN ?
  (no peer should send you route which are not in the negociated AFI/SAFI families and we do not really care if they do but we should)

LATER
- http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-idr-bgp-extended-messages-02.txt
- use the same logic/api in configuration for aspath that has been used for clusterlist ?
- handle correctly the death of helper processes
- look at the Inet, IPv4 and NLRI class to see if it can be simplied
- look at the classes to reduce conversion and improve perf
- look what fun RFC we could implement from the list at 
  http://code.google.com/p/exabgp/wiki/RFC
- Break protocol.py in several files
- change the order for all calls to be afi,safi,<data>
- packed_afi to return SAFI ?

This is an informal roadmap - no promise, just here to remind me what I want to do

ROADMAP

Version 3.0
- usual bug fixes and improvments (bugs ? which bugs ?)
- move the generation of the route when the delta is done in an object with the peer info to display the route change in the log
- use a cache for the object created in the configuration too
- improve the Route objects API

Version 3.1
- keep route grouping provided by the routers who sent them to us.


Helpers
- provide an helper program able to read MRT dumps and announce them too.

Notes
- do we really need to remove a route before re-announcing it or can we just "overwrite" it
- if we define the same route twice in the configuration we will/may send a withdraw before the announce .. 
- UsePath should really be storing things ASN4, UsePath, etc. ie: open negociation so it is one args to functions
- Attributes / MultiAttributes API ?

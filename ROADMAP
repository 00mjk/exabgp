This is an informal roadmap - no promise

ROADMAP

Version 3.
- usual bug fixes and improvments (bugs ? which bugs ?)
- protect the forked process do not have to deal with SIGHUP or others signals sent to exabgp (done ? to test)
- multiple configuration files as paramter (considering)
- have a command to shutdown the process properly

MEMO
- break protocol.py in several files ? 
- look at the classes to reduce conversion and improve perf
- focus on performance : always store packed data
- change the configuration to allow grouping of attributes for routes
- keep route grouping provided by the routers who sent them to us.
- move the generation of the route when the delta is done in an object with the peer info to display the route change in the log
- use a cache for the object created in the configuration too
- provide an helper program able to read MRT dumps and announce them too.
- cleanup the community code the same way we cleanup the aspath and others
- remove all the __repr__ using str
- group routes generated to be nicer on the router CPU.
- do we really need to remove a route before re-announcing it or can we just "overwrite" it
- better store the union of both peers families

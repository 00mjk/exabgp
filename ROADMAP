This is an informal roadmap - no promise

ROADMAP

Version 3.
- usual bug fixes and improvments
- http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-idr-bgp-extended-messages-02.txt
- an exception interception wrapper so forked process do not die on signal sent to exabgp
  (or an helper program automatically called when forking)
- multiple configuration files as paramter (considering)
- have a command to shutdown the process properly
- check that the route received are well from a family negociated during the OPEN
  (no peer should do this, we do not really care but we should)

LATER
- look what fun RFC we could implement from the list at 
  http://code.google.com/p/exabgp/wiki/RFC

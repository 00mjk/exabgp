Description: ExaBGP configuration changes
 Starting with ExaBGP 3.0.0, the environment variables used to configure the ExaBGP daemon are stored under /etc/exabpg/exabgp.env
 The variables related to the daemon startup (EXABGP_RUN, DAEMON_OPTS and ETC) remain under /etc/default/exabgp

 This package will autogenerate the exabgp.env file based on your previous configuration.
 If you let DPKG replace /etc/default/exabgp with the package version, the new file will be adapted to include your previous settings.

This is an informal roadmap - no promise

ROADMAP

Version 3.
- usual bug fixes and improvments (bugs ? which bugs ?)
- protect the forked process do not have to deal with SIGHUP or others signals sent to exabgp (done ? to test)
- multiple configuration files as paramter (considering)
- have a command to shutdown the process properly
- check that the route received are well from a family negociated during the OPEN
  (no peer should send you route which are not in the negociated AFI/SAFI families and we do not really care if they do but we should)

LATER
- http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-idr-bgp-extended-messages-02.txt
- vpnv4 - really this is now missing ... must find the motivation .
- look what fun RFC we could implement from the list at

" Starting with ExaBGP 3.0.0, the file /etc/exabgp/exabgp.env is used to "
"store the environment variables to configure the ExaBGP daemon.\n"
" The variables related to the daemon startup (EXABGP_RUN, DAEMON_OPTS and "
"ETC) remain under /etc/default/exabgp.\n"
" This package will autogenerate the exabgp.env file based on your previous "
"configuration.\n"
" If you let DPKG replace /etc/default/exabgp with the package version, the "
"new file will be adapted to include your previous settings."

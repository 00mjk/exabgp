This is an informal roadmap - no promise, just here to remind me what I want to do

ROADMAP

Route is a terrible class we should have NLRI and Attributes, Updates, no Route

Version 3.0
- usual bug fixes and improvments (bugs ? which bugs ?)
- move the generation of the route when the delta is done in an object with the peer info to display the route change in the log
- use a cache for the object created in the configuration too
- improve the Route objects API
- Change sure all the Message have the API new() and factory() and empty __init__
- Let the forked process indicate when it has finished and do not kill it before then
- Make sure all the capabilities are printed when the neighbor is printed

Version 3.1
- keep route grouping provided by the routers who sent them to us.
- create a capability section under neighbor for capability negociation options
- per neighbor route announcement
- MRT compatible helpers
- provide an helper program able to read MRT dumps and announce them too.
- route refresh
- operational draft support
- fix code testing coverage
- provide easy integration with http://www.spamhaus.org/bgpf/ and http://www.spamhaus.org/drop/


Notes
- if we define the same route twice in the configuration we will/may send them both .. 
- Attributes / MultiAttributes API ?
- warn if an as-path has the router ASN on an ibgp connection
- Some of the match condition of flows currently take list or numeric tests, they should always take both, refactor
- We can not parse flows (yet)
- reading stderr from forked process and displaying via the self.logger class
- Do not announce route of a AFI/SAFI pair if the pair was not received on the OPEN by the peer (done ?)
- NotificationID
- For the first run, add a grouping of route BEFORE the OPEN negociation to not cause issues with OPEN
- allow per per announcement of routes from the helper program
- on unhandled exception, stop all the workers
- look at tox http://tox.testrun.org/latest/

Important
* Write the documentation, and do not rely on the example and the site wiki (argh ...)
* Rewrite the unittesting which is really missing.
* Look at all the XXX: in the code
